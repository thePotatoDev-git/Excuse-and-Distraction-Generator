## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs

After being introduced to APIs, I wanted to explore what more I could do with APIs. I combined a "Random Excuse" API and a "Random Fact" API for this app to create an Excuse and Distraction generator.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that there was a vast amount of APIs out in the wild that people have created for others to use. It was like walking around a public library that allowed you to check out any API you could think of, and use it for your own apps. It was amazing to see that there was an API for almost anything, and you don't even need to know how exactly the API works to use them.
